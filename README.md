# Faction SC

The Faction SC is meant to be used by the members of each faction of Karitha.

## Usage

At the moment it is used via Discord, but it is ment to be used by a Multisign Contract, so each faction member can vote and participate in decision making. A Multisign DApp is currently implemented by the Elrond Team at <https://devnet-multisig.elrond.com/> and will probably arrive into mainnet soon.

## Test

Tests are inside the test directory and they can be ran using: ```cargo test```.

## Contribute

One of the purposes of this SC is to involve the community into developing SC on Elrond! By hands on experience and guidance from the Karitha Core team devs.

When adding a new feature, open a PR and don't forget to add tests, snipets and to update this README :)

## First challange

Fill in the ```todo``` by implementing the ```buyCardFromDeadrare``` function.
